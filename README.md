##Overview
```
The reflection classes, such as Method, are found in java.lang.reflect. 
There are three steps that must be followed to use these classes. 
The first step is to obtain a java.lang.Class object for the class that 
you want to manipulate. java.lang.Class is used to represent classes and interfaces 
in a running Java program.
